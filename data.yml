  Since 2005, I've been doing full-stack work on complex web
  platforms. The majority of my experience has been with e-commerce
  systems on a Microsoft tech stack. I have worked autonomously, led
  teams and mentored junior developers throughout my career. I have
  extensive experience analyzing complex legacy systems, refactoring
  them for performance, security, scalability and reliability. I've
  been involved in the architecture of several platforms and ported
  multiple systems to modern tech stacks!
